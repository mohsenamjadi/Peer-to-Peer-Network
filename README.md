# Peer-to-Peer-Network
peer-to-peer network implemented by python

This is an implementation of a peer to peer network by python.
Each node in the network find itâ€™s neighbors and start to send messages (packets). 
Output is generated 	for topology of the network, history of connected neighbors, list of valid unidirectional and bidirectional neighbors 
and also availability of each node for other nodes in the network, as JSON 	files.
