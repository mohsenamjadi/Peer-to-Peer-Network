# Peer-to-Peer-Network
peer-to-peer network implemented by python

This is an implementation of a peer to peer network by python.
Each node in the network finds itâ€™s neighbors and starts to send messages (packets). 
Outputs is generated for topology of the network, history of the connected neighbors, list of valid unidirectional and bidirectional neighbors 
and also availability of each node for other nodes in the network, as JSON 	files.
